# Zalo
React Native Lab - Zalo

## Review 💻🤓🤔
Screen navigation is important to providing an engaging experience for users.
A Stack Navigator has screens stacked one on top of the other. We can go "down" and "up"
A Tab Navigator has tabs at the bottom of the screen.
A Drawer Navigator has a drawer that's hidden away from view until a user wants access to it.
Screens defined in our Navigators are all passed a prop from React Navigation called navigation.
The navigation prop is very useful prop because the object has many useful key's that we'll need in the future.
Navigation Options is how we'll customize headers, icons, display text, & etc. for our navigators.
